### II. The OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025

The 2025 list introduces critical updates and refined understandings of existing risks. Notably, "Unbounded Consumption" expands upon the previous "Denial of Service," while "Vector and Embeddings" addresses the growing importance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and embedding-based methods. Additionally, "System Prompt Leakage" has been added due to real-world exploits, and "Excessive Agency" has been expanded to account for the increased use of agentic architectures.

Below is a detailed breakdown of each of the ten vulnerabilities:

#### A. LLM01:2025 Prompt Injection

**Description**: Prompt Injection occurs when **user prompts illicitly alter an LLM's behavior or output** in unintended ways. These malicious inputs can influence the model even if they are not human-readable. Such vulnerabilities stem from how models process prompts and may force the model to incorrectly pass data, potentially leading to violations of guidelines, generation of harmful content, unauthorized access, or manipulation of critical decisions. Techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning do not fully mitigate this risk.
*   **Jailbreaking** is a specific form of prompt injection where an attacker's inputs cause the model to completely disregard its safety protocols.

**Types of Prompt Injection Vulnerabilities**:
*   **Direct Prompt Injections**: Occur when a user's prompt directly and unintentionally or intentionally alters the model's behavior.
*   **Indirect Prompt Injections**: Happen when an LLM accepts input from external sources (e.g., websites, files) that contain hidden content designed to alter the model's behavior.

**Common Impacts/Risks**:
*   **Disclosure of sensitive information**, including details about AI system infrastructure or system prompts.
*   **Content manipulation**, leading to incorrect or biased outputs.
*   **Providing unauthorized access** to functions available to the LLM.
*   **Executing arbitrary commands** in connected systems.
*   **Manipulating critical decision-making processes**.
The rise of multimodal AI further expands the attack surface, as attackers can hide instructions in images accompanying benign text.

**Prevention and Mitigation Strategies**: Due to the stochastic nature of generative AI, fool-proof prevention methods are unclear, but mitigation measures can significantly reduce impact.
*   **Constrain model behavior**: Provide explicit instructions on the model's role, capabilities, and limitations within the system prompt, enforcing context adherence and limiting responses to specific tasks.
*   **Define and validate expected output formats**: Specify clear output formats, request detailed reasoning, and use deterministic code for validation.
*   **Implement input and output filtering**: Define sensitive categories and rules for handling such content, applying semantic filters and string-checking, and evaluating responses using the RAG Triad (context relevance, groundedness, question/answer relevance).
*   **Enforce privilege control and least privilege access**: Provide the application with its own API tokens for functions and restrict the model's access privileges to the absolute minimum necessary.
*   **Require human approval for high-risk actions**: Implement "human-in-the-loop" controls for privileged operations.
*   **Segregate and identify external content**: Clearly mark untrusted content to limit its influence on user prompts.
*   **Conduct adversarial testing and attack simulations**: Regularly perform penetration testing and breach simulations, treating the model as an untrusted user.

#### B. LLM02:2025 Sensitive Information Disclosure

**Description**: This vulnerability involves the **unintended exposure of sensitive data**—such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial details, health records, confidential business data, security credentials, or legal documents—through an LLM's output. Proprietary models may also risk exposing unique training methods and source code. This can lead to unauthorized data access, privacy violations, and intellectual property breaches. Users should be aware of the risks of unintentionally providing sensitive data that may later be disclosed.

**Common Examples of Vulnerability**:
*   **PII Leakage**: Personal identifiable information may be disclosed during LLM interactions.
*   **Proprietary Algorithm Exposure**: Poorly configured model outputs can reveal proprietary algorithms or data. This includes **inversion attacks**, where attackers extract sensitive information or reconstruct inputs from disclosed training data, as seen in the 'Proof Pudding' attack (CVE-2019-20634).
*   **Sensitive Business Data Disclosure**: Generated responses might inadvertently include confidential business information.

**Prevention and Mitigation Strategies**:
*   **Data Sanitization**: Implement techniques to scrub or mask sensitive content before it is used in training.
*   **Robust Input Validation**: Apply strict methods to detect and filter out potentially harmful or sensitive data inputs.
*   **Access Controls**: Enforce strict controls based on the **principle of least privilege**, limiting access to only necessary data. Restrict model access to external data sources and securely manage runtime data orchestration.
*   **Federated Learning and Privacy Techniques**: Utilize decentralized training to minimize centralized data collection. Incorporate **Differential Privacy** to add noise to data or outputs, making reverse-engineering difficult.
*   **User Education and Transparency**: Guide users on safe LLM usage, avoid inputting sensitive information, and ensure clear data retention policies, allowing users to opt out of data inclusion in training.
*   **Secure System Configuration**: **Conceal the system preamble** to limit access to internal configurations. Follow "OWASP API8:2023 Security Misconfiguration" guidelines.
*   **Advanced Techniques**: Employ **Homomorphic Encryption** for secure data analysis. Implement **Tokenization and Redaction** using pattern matching to preprocess and sanitize sensitive information.

#### C. LLM03:2025 Supply Chain

**Description**: LLM supply chains are vulnerable to integrity issues in training data, models, and deployment platforms, leading to **biased outputs, security breaches, or system failures**. Unlike traditional software, ML risks extend to third-party pre-trained models and data, which can be tampered with or poisoned. The rise of open-access LLMs, fine-tuning methods like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) on platforms like Hugging Face, and on-device LLMs introduce new supply-chain risks.

**Common Examples of Risks**:
*   **Traditional Third-party Package Vulnerabilities**: Exploitable outdated or deprecated components, similar to "A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components".
*   **Licensing Risks**: Unmanaged diverse software and dataset licenses can create legal issues due to usage, distribution, or commercialization restrictions.
*   **Outdated or Deprecated Models**: Using unmaintained models leads to security issues.
*   **Vulnerable Pre-Trained Models**: Binary black boxes that can contain hidden biases, backdoors, or malicious features (e.g., via poisoned datasets or direct model tampering like ROME/lobotomisation).
*   **Weak Model Provenance**: Lack of strong assurances about model origin, allowing attackers to compromise supplier accounts or use social engineering.
*   **Vulnerable LoRA Adapters**: Malicious LoRA adapters can compromise the integrity and security of pre-trained base models, especially in collaborative model merge environments or inference platforms supporting LoRA.
*   **Exploiting Collaborative Development Processes**: Model merge and handling services (e.g., conversions) in shared environments can be exploited to introduce vulnerabilities and bypass reviews.
*   **LLM Model on Device Supply-Chain Vulnerabilities**: Increased attack surface from compromised manufacturing processes or device OS/firmware vulnerabilities, allowing reverse-engineering and repackaging with tampered models.
*   **Unclear T&Cs and Data Privacy Policies**: Leading to sensitive application data being used for model training and subsequent exposure, or risks from copyrighted material.

**Prevention and Mitigation Strategies**:
*   **Carefully Vet Data Sources and Suppliers**: Review T&Cs and privacy policies, using only trusted suppliers, and regularly audit their security posture.
*   **Apply OWASP Top Ten A06:2021 Mitigations**: Including vulnerability scanning, management, and patching.
*   **Comprehensive AI Red Teaming and Evaluations**: Evaluate third-party models extensively, especially for planned use cases.
*   **Maintain an Up-to-Date Inventory with SBOMs**: Use Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs), specifically AI BOMs and ML SBOMs, to ensure accurate, signed inventories for detecting zero-day vulnerabilities.
*   **Mitigate AI Licensing Risks**: Inventory licenses using BOMs, conduct regular audits, use automated tools, and maintain detailed documentation.
*   **Use Models from Verifiable Sources**: Implement third-party model integrity checks with signing and file hashes to compensate for weak provenance, and use code signing for external code.
*   **Strict Monitoring and Auditing for Collaborative Environments**: Detect abuse in model development environments.
*   **Anomaly Detection and Adversarial Robustness Tests**: Detect tampering and poisoning in supplied models and data, ideally integrated into MLOps/LLM pipelines.
*   **Implement a Patching Policy**: Ensure reliance on maintained versions of APIs and underlying models.
*   **Encrypt Models Deployed at AI Edge**: Include integrity checks and vendor attestation APIs to prevent tampered apps and models.

#### D. LLM04: Data and Model Poisoning

**Description**: Data poisoning involves the **manipulation of pre-training, fine-tuning, or embedding data to introduce vulnerabilities, backdoors, or biases**. This compromises model security, performance, or ethical behavior. It is considered an integrity attack as it directly impacts the model's ability to make accurate predictions. Risks are high with external data sources. Malicious pickling can embed malware, and poisoning can create **"sleeper agents"**—backdoors that remain dormant until triggered.

**Common Examples of Vulnerability**:
*   **Malicious Actors Introduce Harmful Data**: Leading to biased outputs, using techniques like "Split-View Data Poisoning" or "Frontrunning Poisoning".
*   **Direct Injection of Harmful Content**: Compromising model output quality.
*   **Unwitting User Injection**: Users unknowingly injecting sensitive or proprietary information.
*   **Unverified Training Data**: Increases the risk of biased or erroneous outputs.
*   **Lack of Resource Access Restrictions**: Allowing ingestion of unsafe data, resulting in biased outputs.

**Prevention and Mitigation Strategies**:
*   **Track Data Origins and Transformations**: Using tools like OWASP CycloneDX or ML-BOM, and verify data legitimacy.
*   **Rigorous Vendor Vetting and Output Validation**: Vet data vendors strictly and validate model outputs against trusted sources.
*   **Implement Strict Sandboxing**: Limit model exposure to unverified data sources and use anomaly detection.
*   **Tailor Models for Use Cases**: Use specific datasets for fine-tuning to produce accurate outputs.
*   **Ensure Sufficient Infrastructure Controls**: Prevent the model from accessing unintended data sources.
*   **Use Data Version Control (DVC)**: Track changes in datasets to detect manipulation.
*   **Store User-Supplied Information in Vector Database**: Allows adjustments without full retraining.
*   **Test Model Robustness**: Conduct red team campaigns and adversarial techniques, like federated learning.
*   **Monitor Training Loss and Model Behavior**: Detect signs of poisoning using thresholds.
*   **Integrate RAG and Grounding Techniques during Inference**: Reduce risks of hallucinations.

#### E. LLM05:2025 Improper Output Handling

**Description**: This refers to **insufficient validation, sanitization, and handling of LLM-generated outputs** before they are passed downstream to other components or systems. Since LLM output can be controlled by prompt input, this is akin to giving users indirect access to additional functionality. Successful exploitation can lead to XSS and CSRF in web browsers, or SSRF, privilege escalation, or remote code execution on backend systems.

**Conditions Increasing Impact**:
*   LLM having privileges beyond what's intended for end users.
*   Application being vulnerable to indirect prompt injection.
*   Third-party extensions not adequately validating inputs.
*   Lack of proper output encoding for different contexts (e.g., HTML, JavaScript, SQL).
*   Insufficient monitoring and logging of LLM outputs.
*   Absence of rate limiting or anomaly detection for LLM usage.

**Common Examples of Vulnerability**:
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: LLM output entered directly into a system shell or functions like `exec` or `eval`.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: JavaScript or Markdown generated by the LLM and interpreted by a browser.
*   **SQL Injection**: LLM-generated SQL queries executed without proper parameterization.
*   **Path Traversal**: LLM output used to construct file paths without sanitization.
*   **Phishing Attacks**: LLM-generated content used in email templates without proper escaping.

**Prevention and Mitigation Strategies**:
*   **Treat the model as any other user**: Adopt a zero-trust approach and apply proper input validation on responses from the model to backend functions.
*   **Follow OWASP ASVS Guidelines**: Ensure effective input validation and sanitization.
*   **Encode Model Output Back to Users**: Mitigate undesired code execution by JavaScript or Markdown, following OWASP ASVS guidance on output encoding.
*   **Implement Context-Aware Output Encoding**: Based on where the LLM output will be used (e.g., HTML encoding, SQL escaping).
*   **Use Parameterized Queries or Prepared Statements**: For all database operations involving LLM output.
*   **Employ Strict Content Security Policies (CSP)**: Mitigate XSS attacks from LLM-generated content.
*   **Implement Robust Logging and Monitoring Systems**: Detect unusual patterns in LLM outputs.

#### F. LLM06:2025 Excessive Agency

**Description**: This vulnerability occurs when an LLM-based system is granted an **undue degree of agency**—the ability to call functions or interface with other systems via extensions (tools, skills, plugins) in response to prompts. The decision to invoke extensions might be dynamically determined by an LLM 'agent'. Excessive Agency enables damaging actions in response to unexpected, ambiguous, or manipulated LLM outputs, triggered by hallucination, poor prompts, or direct/indirect prompt injection.
*   The **root cause** is typically excessive functionality, excessive permissions, or excessive autonomy.
*   Excessive Agency differs from Improper Output Handling, focusing on the LLM's actions rather than merely the scrutiny of its outputs.

**Common Examples of Risks**:
*   **Excessive Functionality**: An LLM agent having access to functions not needed for the system's intended operation (e.g., ability to modify/delete documents when only reading is required). This includes open-ended extensions that fail to filter input instructions.
*   **Excessive Permissions**: An LLM extension having more permissions on downstream systems than necessary (e.g., UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE access when only SELECT is needed). This also includes extensions accessing systems with a generic high-privileged identity instead of the individual user's context.
*   **Excessive Autonomy**: An LLM-based application or extension failing to independently verify and approve high-impact actions (e.g., deleting user documents without confirmation).

**Prevention and Mitigation Strategies**:
*   **Minimize Extensions**: Limit extensions offered to the LLM agent to only the absolute minimum necessary.
*   **Minimize Extension Functionality**: Implement only the necessary functions within LLM extensions (e.g., only mail-reading, not sending).
*   **Avoid Open-Ended Extensions**: Prefer extensions with granular functionality over broad ones (e.g., a specific file-writing extension instead of a general shell command execution).
*   **Minimize Extension Permissions**: Limit permissions granted to LLM extensions on other systems to the least necessary, enforced by appropriate database permissions or access controls.
*   **Execute Extensions in User's Context**: Track user authorization and security scope to ensure actions are performed with minimum privileges and in the context of the specific user (e.g., OAuth with read-only scope).
*   **Require User Approval**: Implement "human-in-the-loop" controls for high-impact actions.
*   **Complete Mediation**: Enforce authorization in downstream systems rather than relying on the LLM to decide if an action is allowed, validating all requests against security policies.
*   **Sanitize LLM Inputs and Outputs**: Follow secure coding best practices, apply OWASP ASVS recommendations, and use SAST/DAST/IAST in development pipelines.
*   **Limit Damage (not prevent)**: Log and monitor LLM extension activity and downstream systems to identify undesirable actions. Implement rate-limiting to reduce the number of undesirable actions within a given time period.

#### G. LLM07:2025 System Prompt Leakage

**Description**: This vulnerability is the risk that **system prompts or instructions, designed to steer the model's behavior, inadvertently contain sensitive information** not intended for discovery. While system prompts guide the model, they should **not be considered secrets or security controls**, and sensitive data like credentials or connection strings should never be embedded within them. The fundamental security risk isn't the disclosure of the prompt itself, but rather that the application delegates strong session management and authorization checks to the LLM, or that sensitive data is stored improperly. Attackers can often deduce guardrails and formatting restrictions even without direct disclosure.

**Common Examples of Risk**:
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Functionality**: System prompts revealing sensitive architecture, API keys, database credentials, or user tokens, which attackers can use for unauthorized access (e.g., knowing database type for SQL injection).
*   **Exposure of Internal Rules**: System prompts revealing confidential internal decision-making processes, allowing attackers to bypass controls (e.g., banking chatbot revealing transaction limits).
*   **Revealing Filtering Criteria**: System prompts disclosing how the model filters or rejects sensitive content.
*   **Disclosure of Permissions and User Roles**: System prompts revealing internal role structures or permission levels, aiding privilege escalation attacks.

**Prevention and Mitigation Strategies**:
*   **Separate Sensitive Data from System Prompts**: Avoid embedding sensitive information directly; externalize such data to systems the model doesn't directly access.
*   **Avoid Reliance on System Prompts for Strict Behavior Control**: LLMs are susceptible to prompt injections, so rely on external systems to enforce behavior like harmful content detection.
*   **Implement Guardrails Outside the LLM**: Use independent systems to inspect output and ensure compliance with expectations, rather than solely relying on system prompt instructions.
*   **Ensure Security Controls are Enforced Independently from the LLM**: Critical controls like privilege separation and authorization checks must be deterministic and auditable, not delegated to LLMs. If agents perform tasks requiring different access levels, use multiple agents each with least privileges.

#### H. LLM08:2025 Vector and Embedding Weaknesses

**Description**: This vulnerability involves significant security risks in systems using **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs**, specifically weaknesses in how vectors and embeddings are generated, stored, or retrieved. These weaknesses can be exploited by malicious or unintentional actions to inject harmful content, manipulate model outputs, or access sensitive information. RAG enhances LLM performance by combining pre-trained models with external knowledge sources, using vector mechanisms and embeddings.

**Common Examples of Risks**:
*   **Unauthorized Access & Data Leakage**: Inadequate access controls leading to unauthorized access to embeddings containing sensitive information (personal data, proprietary information). Unauthorized use of copyrighted material can also lead to legal repercussions.
*   **Cross-Context Information Leaks and Federation Knowledge Conflict**: In multi-tenant environments, a risk of context leakage between users or queries in shared vector databases. Data federation knowledge conflict occurs when data from multiple sources contradict or when the LLM cannot supersede old training knowledge with new RAG data.
*   **Embedding Inversion Attacks**: Attackers exploiting vulnerabilities to invert embeddings and recover significant amounts of source information, compromising data confidentiality.
*   **Data Poisoning Attacks**: Intentional or unintentional poisoning of data from various sources (insiders, prompts, unverified providers) leading to manipulated model outputs.
*   **Behavior Alteration**: Retrieval Augmentation inadvertently altering the foundational model's behavior, potentially reducing desired qualities like emotional intelligence or empathy, even while improving factual accuracy.

**Prevention and Mitigation Strategies**:
*   **Permission and Access Control**: Implement fine-grained access controls and permission-aware vector/embedding stores. Ensure strict logical and access partitioning of datasets in the vector database.
*   **Data Validation & Source Authentication**: Implement robust data validation pipelines for knowledge sources. Regularly audit the integrity of the knowledge base for hidden codes and data poisoning. Accept data only from trusted and verified sources.
*   **Data Review for Combination & Classification**: Thoroughly review combined datasets from different sources. Tag and classify data within the knowledge base to control access levels and prevent data mismatch errors.
*   **Monitoring and Logging**: Maintain detailed, immutable logs of retrieval activities to detect and respond to suspicious behavior promptly.

#### I. LLM09:2025 Misinformation

**Description**: Misinformation from LLMs is a core vulnerability where models produce **false or misleading information that appears credible**. This can result in security breaches, reputational damage, and legal liability. A major cause is **hallucination**, where LLMs generate fabricated but seemingly accurate content by filling gaps in training data using statistical patterns, without true understanding. Biases in training data and incomplete information also contribute.
*   **Overreliance**: A related issue where users place excessive trust in LLM-generated content without verification, exacerbating the impact of misinformation.

**Common Examples of Risk**:
*   **Factual Inaccuracies**: Model producing incorrect statements, leading to decisions based on false information (e.g., Air Canada chatbot providing misinformation).
*   **Unsupported Claims**: Model generating baseless assertions, especially harmful in sensitive contexts like healthcare or legal proceedings (e.g., ChatGPT fabricating legal cases).
*   **Misrepresentation of Expertise**: Model creating the illusion of understanding complex topics, misleading users about its expertise (e.g., chatbots misrepresenting health issues).
*   **Unsafe Code Generation**: Model suggesting insecure or non-existent code libraries, introducing vulnerabilities when integrated into software systems (e.g., LLMs proposing insecure third-party libraries).

**Prevention and Mitigation Strategies**:
*   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Enhance reliability by retrieving relevant and verified information from trusted external databases during response generation, mitigating hallucinations.
*   **Model Fine-Tuning**: Improve output quality using techniques like parameter-efficient tuning (PET) and chain-of-thought prompting to reduce misinformation.
*   **Cross-Verification and Human Oversight**: Encourage users to cross-check LLM outputs with trusted sources. Implement human oversight and fact-checking, especially for critical information, ensuring reviewers avoid overreliance on AI.
*   **Automatic Validation Mechanisms**: Implement tools to automatically validate key outputs, particularly in high-stakes environments.
*   **Risk Communication**: Clearly communicate risks and limitations of LLM-generated content to users, including the potential for misinformation.
*   **Secure Coding Practices**: Establish practices to prevent vulnerability introduction from incorrect code suggestions.
*   **User Interface Design**: Design APIs and UIs to encourage responsible LLM use, integrating content filters, clearly labeling AI-generated content, and informing users of reliability limitations.
*   **Training and Education**: Provide comprehensive training on LLM limitations, the importance of independent verification, and critical thinking, including domain-specific evaluation.

#### J. LLM10:2025 Unbounded Consumption

**Description**: Unbounded Consumption occurs when an LLM application allows users to conduct **excessive and uncontrolled inferences**, leading to risks like denial of service (DoS), economic losses, model theft, and service degradation. The high computational demands of LLMs, especially in cloud environments, make them susceptible to resource exploitation and unauthorized usage. Attacks aiming to disrupt service, deplete financial resources, or steal intellectual property often leverage this vulnerability.

**Common Examples of Vulnerability**:
*   **Variable-Length Input Flood**: Attackers overloading the LLM with numerous inputs of varying lengths, depleting resources and rendering the system unresponsive.
*   **Denial of Wallet (DoW)**: Initiating a high volume of operations to exploit the cost-per-use model of cloud-based AI services, causing unsustainable financial burdens.
*   **Continuous Input Overflow**: Sending continuous inputs that exceed the LLM's context window, leading to excessive computational resource use and service degradation.
*   **Resource-Intensive Queries**: Submitting unusually demanding queries that drain system resources, causing prolonged processing times and potential failures.
*   **Model Extraction via API**: Attackers querying the model API with crafted inputs and prompt injection to collect enough outputs to replicate a partial or shadow model, leading to intellectual property theft and integrity undermining.
*   **Functional Model Replication**: Using the target model to generate synthetic training data to fine-tune another foundational model, creating a functional equivalent and bypassing traditional extraction methods.
*   **Side-Channel Attacks**: Malicious attackers exploiting input filtering techniques to execute side-channel attacks, harvesting model weights and architectural information.

**Prevention and Mitigation Strategies**:
*   **Input Validation**: Implement strict input validation to ensure inputs do not exceed reasonable size limits.
*   **Limit Exposure of Logits and Logprobs**: Restrict or obfuscate these in API responses, providing only necessary information.
*   **Rate Limiting and User Quotas**: Restrict the number of requests a single source entity can make within a given time period.
*   **Resource Allocation Management**: Dynamically monitor and manage resource allocation to prevent excessive consumption by any single user or request.
*   **Timeouts and Throttling**: Set timeouts and throttle processing for resource-intensive operations.
*   **Sandbox Techniques**: Restrict the LLM's access to network resources, internal services, and APIs, serving as a crucial control against side-channel attacks and insider risks.
*   **Comprehensive Logging, Monitoring, and Anomaly Detection**: Continuously monitor resource usage and log unusual patterns.
*   **Watermarking**: Implement frameworks to embed and detect unauthorized use of LLM outputs.
*   **Graceful Degradation**: Design the system to maintain partial functionality under heavy load instead of complete failure.
*   **Limit Queued Actions and Scale Robustly**: Restrict queued actions and integrate dynamic scaling and load balancing.
*   **Adversarial Robustness Training**: Train models to detect and mitigate adversarial queries and extraction attempts.
*   **Glitch Token Filtering**: Build lists of known glitch tokens and scan output before adding to the model’s context window.
*   **Access Controls**: Implement strong controls, including Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and the principle of least privilege, for LLM model repositories and training environments.
*   **Centralized ML Model Inventory**: Use a registry for production models to ensure proper governance and access control.
*   **Automated MLOps Deployment**: Implement automated MLOps deployment with governance, tracking, and approval workflows for tighter access and deployment controls.
